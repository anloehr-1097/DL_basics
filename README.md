# Purpose of this project

This is a purely educational project. The goal is to create a small library with some deep learning primitives from scratch in C++ and along the way,
learn about the C++ std library, the C++ language, and deep learning.

# Next steps
## Finish attention mechanism
### implement slicing
### need to reimplement softmax to account for dimensions
